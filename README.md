# Props And State

This is a basic tutorial of how to create a custom component with Props and State. We created an Image component, and a counter will increase each time it is clicked. Each Image can have its own "src" and "alt" props.

## How To Start

Before you begin, make sure you have the required tools installed on your computer. You can find them [here](https://github.com/ReactBetter/docs/blob/main/install_tools.md).

Make sure you clone this repo on your machine. It will download the entire project for you. Use this command in your terminal where you want to download it:

```
git clone git@github.com:ReactBetter/props-and-state.git
```

After downloading the files, you'll need to install the required React packages.

```
npm install
```

Finally, start the project.

```
npm start
```

This will start the React project on your machine. If your browser didn't automatically open, you should visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
